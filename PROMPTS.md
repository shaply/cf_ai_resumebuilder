## Put AI prompts here

```
Here is my idea that I want to do, can you guide me through what cloudflare agent template to use and what else to do:
I want to build a resume builder application where I can put in various things I've done such as competitions, projects, etc. Then, I have a resume template and I just need the AI to generate bullet points for my activities and I'll fit them into the template. The main point of the application is that I can input the job posting into the app and the AI will generate bullet points to match the job posting, then it will compile the latex document. If the latex document is too long, items and bullet points will be cut out according to the AI, and this process will keep repeating until the resume is one page. The latex thing I'm thinking of using is overleaf (IDK if they have an API or not).
